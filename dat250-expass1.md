# Short report #

### Set-up ###
I had already installed and set-up all required components of this assignment, so my only task in this step was to create a git reposity. 
In other words, I experienced no issues in the set-up of this assignment.

### Heroku tutorial ###
The tutorial for deploying a java application was very straight forward. It took me roughly two hours to complete. 
The only "issue" I had throughout this tutorial was that I initially cloned the project into a seperate folder. I figured after a couple of steps that the code should be in the same folder as my git repository, so I re-did the start of the tutorial so that I could commit it to my git repo.
At the end of the tutorial, I was denied when trying to add an addon. I was promted with a need to verify my account by adding payment details. As the assignment said nothing about this, I decided to skip the addon step.
