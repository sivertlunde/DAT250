## Experiment 1 ##
This was a fairly straight forward exercise. I decided to clone the github-project provided in the assignment. 
From there I looked at the tutorial from vogella. I managed to get through the steps without major difficulties. 
The only one that comes to mind was a line of code in the persistance.xml where the line for creating the tables was commented out in the cloned project.
This threw an error which led me to find the solution which was to simply un-comment it.

## Experiment 2 ##
I completed this assignment by going back and forth between looking at the course videos on the subject, and coding. 
This helped me as everything was fresh in memory as I was solving the exercise. 
I inspected the database created through the terminal using the derby tool "ij".
This let me connect to the db, inspect its content and run sql-queries.
The program made tables for all the "@Entity"-marked classes as well as the joined tables "people_addresses" and "person_cards".
